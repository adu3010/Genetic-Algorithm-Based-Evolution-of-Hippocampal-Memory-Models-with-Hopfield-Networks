# Genetic-Algorithm-Based-Evolution-of-Hippocampal-Memory-Models-with-Hopfield-Networks
We explore the use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to evolve Hippocampal Memory Circuits modelled using Hopfield Networks. The hippocampus, a critical brain region for memory formation and retrieval, serves as inspiration for our computational model.
