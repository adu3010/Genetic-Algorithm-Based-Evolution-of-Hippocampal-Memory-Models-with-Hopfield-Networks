# Genetic-Algorithm-Based-Evolution-of-Hippocampal-Memory-Models-with-Hopfield-Networks
We explore the use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to evolve Hippocampal Memory Circuits modelled using Hopfield Networks. The hippocampus, a critical brain region for memory formation and retrieval, serves as inspiration for our computational model. 

Hopfield Networks, known for their associative memory capabilities, are employed to simulate the behaviour of hippocampal circuits. By harnessing the optimization power of GAs, we aim to enhance the performance and efficiency of these networks in learning and recalling patterns.
